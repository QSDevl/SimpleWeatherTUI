## üöÄ Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You'll need .NET 9 installed on your system. You can download it from [dotnet.microsoft.com](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/9.0).

This application also requires an API key from a weather service. This project uses OpenWeatherMap, but if you're feeling adventurous, you can change the code to make it your own API.

1.  Go to [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) and create a free account.
2.  Once logged in, navigate to the "API keys" section to generate your key.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/QSDevl/SimpleWeatherTUI.git
    cd SimpleWeatherTUI
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    dotnet restore
    ```

3.  **Configure your API Key:**

    Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project and add your OpenWeatherMap API key:

    ```
    OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
    ```

    (Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with the actual API key you obtained from OpenWeatherMap.)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

To get the weather for a specific city, run the script with the city name as an argument:

```bash
python weather_app.py "New York"
```

You can also specify a country code for more precise results (e.g., for cities with the same name in different countries):

```bash
/opt/ "London, UK"
```

### Example Output

```
Weather in London, UK:
Temperature: 15.0¬∞C
Humidity: 80%
Wind Speed: 5.2 m/s
Conditions: Clouds
```
